            <h3> This is my dog Brooklyn! He is a 10 year old Maltipoo, so he is a mix of a maltese and a poodle! He loves to play, give kisses, and cuddle up in a warm blanket. He also loves to chill by the fireplace when it is on in the winter!</h3>

            <h3> He is 10 years old. He has a heart condition and must take 3 medicines in the morning and 4 medicines at night for the rest of his life! He has been through a lot, but despite it all, he made it through better than ever! He is 5.5 pounds and is full of joy. Sometimes I have to sit with him so he eats. He is pretty much a human, and doesn't like to eat unless he has company, so yes, I spoil him. </h3>
